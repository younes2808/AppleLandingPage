# iPhone 15 Pro Website Recreation

This is a recreation of the official iPhone 15 Pro Apple website, built using React and Vite. The project utilizes GSAP and Three.js frameworks to create dynamic and interactive animations, aiming to replicate the immersive experience found on the original product page.

## 🎯 Goals
The primary goals of this project were to:
- Recreate the iPhone 15 Pro product page with smooth animations and 3D effects.
- Learn and apply GSAP for advanced animations.
- Integrate Three.js for 3D rendering and interactive elements.
- Enhance React development skills and explore Vite as a bundler.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For complex animations and smooth transitions.
- **Three.js**: For 3D models and interactive visual elements.
  
## 🌟 Features
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **3D Animations**: Smooth and interactive 3D animations using Three.js.
- **Scroll-triggered Effects**: Animations triggered as users scroll through the page using GSAP.
- **High Performance**: Built with Vite for fast loading times and optimized performance.

## 📝 Future Plans
This project serves as a learning foundation for creating my own personal portfolio website, which is currently under development. The skills gained here, especially in animation and 3D rendering, will be applied to make a highly interactive portfolio website.

## 📚 Inspiration
This project was built following a tutorial by **JavaScript Mastery**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRQbRAJ4-Fs&t=6903s], which provided great insights into building modern web applications with React, GSAP, and Three.js.
